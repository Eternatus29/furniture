## Semester VI End Term exam submission
### Steps to run the app
1. `npm i` to install dependencies. I used node version 20.12.2
2. `npm run serve` to start the server with nodemon.
3. Visit `http:localhost:3000` in a browser.

Note: I have not added any dummy data or seed file. But all routes as per requirements are present.
